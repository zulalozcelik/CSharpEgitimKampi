⏳C# EĞİTİM KAMPI⏳
                                                 
I had the opportunity to improve myself more than I expected in this camp, which I started with the aim of starting from the basics of the C# programming language to advanced levels and better understanding the logic of object-oriented programming. This repo, to which I continue to add files under the guidance of Murat Yücedağ, currently consists of 9 projects. Below you can find technical details for each project:

Project 1: Main Subjects
In this project, I learned how to print what I want to the console and how to use int and string variable types.

Project 2: Variables /n
In this project, I learned how to input variables such as double char string from the user and use them in the program.

Project 3: Making Decision
In this project, I did some mathematical operations to better understand the usage logic of if, if else and switch case structures.

Project 4: Loops
In this project, I used the making decision structures I learned in the previous lesson, together with while and for loops to make more easier repetitive operations.

Project 5: Loop with Starts
In this project, I did some logical operations using the for loop.

Project 6: Arrays
In this project, I learned how to list the elements of the array and create a new array with the values ​​received from the user, by using some methods with arrays.

Project 7: ForechLoop
In this project, I learned that I could use the foreach loop for some repetitive operations instead of using more lines with other loops, and I wrote a simple exam system application using loops.

Project 8: Methods
In this project, I improved my skills in using int string parameters in methods that do and do not return values.

Project 9: Database Project 
In this project, I learned to connect to a database I had previously created and list the desired values ​​from this database.

Project 10: DataBase Crud
In this project, I learned how to add, delete, edit and list data in the database I created on Microsoft SQL Server.
