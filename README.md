I had the opportunity to improve myself more than I expected in this camp, which I started with the aim of starting from the basics of the C# programming language to advanced levels and better understanding the logic of object-oriented programming. This repo, to which I continue to add files under the guidance of Murat Yücedağ, currently consists of 9 projects. Below you can find technical details for each project:
